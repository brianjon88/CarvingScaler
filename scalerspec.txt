Here’s a clear, structured spec you can hand to an AI like Claude Code to vibe-code your carving pattern scaling app in C#. It’s written to be immediately actionable, with modular components, UI expectations, and logic requirements — all grounded in the image you just generated.

## 🧩 Project Spec: Carving Pattern Toolkit (Blazor WebAssembly App)

### **Overview**
This is a C# Blazor WebAssembly app designed to help woodcarvers scale carving patterns between different block sizes, convert measurements between inches and millimeters, and translate decimal inches into standard fractions used on measuring tools. Future support includes scaling uploaded sketches.

---

## 🧱 Core Features

### 1. **Pattern Scaling Tool**
- Input: Original block dimensions (X, Y, Z in inches)
- Input: New block dimensions (X, Y, Z in inches)
- Output: Scale factors for each axis
- Input: Cut line entries (name + original measurement in inches)
- Output: Scaled measurement in inches and millimeters
- Toggle: Display scaled inches as decimal or fraction (1/16", 1/32")

### 2. **Measurement Tools**
- Convert inches ↔ millimeters
- Convert decimal inches ↔ fractional inches
- Support precision toggles: 1/16", 1/32", 1/64"

### 3. **Drawing Scaling (Future)**
- Upload sketch image
- Define reference line in pixels and real-world inches
- Compute scale factor
- Apply scale to image
- Preview and download scaled image

## 🧮 Logic Requirements

### Scaling
```csharp
scaleX = newX / origX;
scaleY = newY / origY;
scaleZ = newZ / origZ;
```

### Cut Line Scaling
```csharp
scaledInches = originalInches * scaleX; // or scaleY/scaleZ depending on axis
scaledMM = scaledInches * 25.4;
```

### Fraction Conversion
```csharp
public static string ToFraction(double value, int denominator = 16)
{
    int num = (int)Math.Round(value * denominator);
    return $"{num}/{denominator}";
}
```

### Unit Conversion
```csharp
mm = inches * 25.4;
inches = mm / 25.4;
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Notes
- Validate scale factor computation with known ratios
- Confirm fraction rounding matches ruler markings
- Ensure cut line table updates dynamically
- Test toggling between decimal and fractional views

---

## 🧭 Future Enhancements
- Image upload and scaling
- Preset block sizes
- Export scaled cut lines to PDF or SVG
- Save/load user presets
